# Path Finder

Interactive maze pathfinding visualizer comparing BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithms with real-time animation and performance analysis.

## Features

- 🎯 **Interactive Maze Generation** - Generate random mazes with customizable size and obstacle density
- 🔄 **Algorithm Comparison** - Run BFS and DFS side-by-side to compare performance
- 🎨 **Beautiful Animations** - Animated snake path visualization showing algorithm traversal
- 📊 **Performance Metrics** - Detailed statistics including execution time, nodes visited, and path length
- 📈 **Visual Analytics** - Charts comparing algorithm performance
- 🎲 **Random Start/End Points** - Each maze features unique start and end positions

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas for path animations
- Vanilla JavaScript for algorithm implementation
- CSS3 with glassmorphism design
- Chart.js for performance visualization

## Usage

1. Adjust maze size and obstacle density using the sliders
2. Click "Generate Maze" to create a new random maze
3. Choose an algorithm:
   - **Run BFS** - Guarantees shortest path
   - **Run DFS** - Memory efficient exploration
   - **Compare Both** - Run both algorithms sequentially
4. Watch the animated visualization and compare statistics
